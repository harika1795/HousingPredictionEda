***California Housing Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Welcome to the California Housing Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository. This project aims to perform EDA on the California Housing Dataset to gain insights into the housing market in California. The dataset contains information about housing prices and various factors that may influence them.

Dataset Description:
The California Housing Dataset contains the following columns:

longitude: Longitude coordinate of the housing location.
latitude: Latitude coordinate of the housing location.
housing_median_age: Median age of the housing units in a block.
total_rooms: Total number of rooms in the block.
total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the block.
population: Total population in the block.
households: Total number of households in the block.
median_income: Median income of households in the block.
median_house_value: Median house value for households in the block (target variable).
ocean_proximity: Proximity to the ocean (categorical variable).
EDA Steps:
Load the Dataset: Load the California Housing Dataset using Pandas or any other relevant library.

Understand the Data: Use functions like head(), info(), and describe() to get an overview of the dataset, including column names, data types, and summary statistics.

Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values in the dataset and decide on a strategy for handling them (e.g., dropping rows, imputation).

Explore Numeric Variables:

Plot histograms or density plots for numeric variables to understand their distributions.
Analyze summary statistics such as mean, median, minimum, and maximum values.
Look for outliers or extreme values.
Explore Categorical Variables:

Plot bar plots to visualize the frequency distribution of different categories in categorical variables.
Analyze the distribution of categories and identify any uncommon or rare categories.
Explore Relationships:

Use scatter plots or pair plots to explore relationships between numeric variables.
Calculate correlation coefficients to quantify the strength and direction of linear relationships.
Visualize relationships between numeric and categorical variables using box plots or violin plots.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features or transformations of existing features that may be useful for modeling.
Visualize Geographical Data (if applicable):

Plot maps to visualize the spatial distribution of housing prices using longitude and latitude coordinates.
Summarize Findings:

Document key findings, patterns, and insights from the EDA process.
Prepare for Modeling:

Based on the insights gained from EDA, prepare the dataset for modeling by preprocessing and feature engineering.
